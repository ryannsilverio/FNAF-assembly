# FNAF-assembly
FNAF Assembly is a custom assembly language inspired by MIPS, designed specifically for creating Five Nights at Freddy's game mechanics.This language extends traditional MIPS architecture with unique instructions for managing animatronics, energy systems, time tracking, and survival mechanics. The language maintains MIPS-style simplicity while adding game-specific operations that make programming night-shift survival scenarios intuitive and efficient.<img width="468" height="83" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30fc7e86-fe33-46c5-9ba6-ce2673d31190" />
